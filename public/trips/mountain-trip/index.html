			<p>This trip lasted three days, and it's worth posting because it was our last trip as a family for some time. I want to look back on it in a few years and remember everything.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>Because we love rivers, we went to <strong>Bajos del Toro, Alajuela</strong>. One of the places we visited had a swimming spot and a waterfall a few meters up, but unofortunately, that was closed. Before heading to the swimming spot, my mom insisted on climbing a hill to take some pictures. No one really wanted to go just for a photo, but we agreed anyway.</p>
<p>I tried taking some pictures, but since I have zero idea of how cameras work, they didn't turn out great so, I won't be posting them. On our way back down, a massive group of people in their 20s was hiking up. I didn't counnt, but there were at least 30 of them.</p>
<p>That was one of the coolest things I've seen, so many people of my age, in a foreign country, probably barely speaking the language, just having fun. I'm planning something like that for myself. Hopefully, it happens. In the end, going up the hill was worth it.</p>
<p>We went to the first spot to swim, water was freezing, it was colder than the last trip I wrote about. I dipped my feet I felt a lot of pain in my bones, it was really cold. I finally plunged and got used to it but not for long. Other people were not swimming for long either.</p>
<p>After that, we headed to our Airbnb in <strong>Zarcero</strong>. On the way there, we passed through mountains, houses looked traditional and, their gardens were beautiful. The place felt very peaceful and quiet. It reminded me of villages in Syria that have existed forever. I wish I had taken pictures, but I was too busy enjoying it.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Airbnb and I wish I took pictures of the place because it was very cool, can't believe the amount of times I missed taking pictures already. It was already late so the day just ended.</p>
<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
<p>The next day we went to hot springs, nicest things ever invented. There is not a lot I can say about it, it was nice. What I would like to talk about is the pictures I took on our way back to our airbnb.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: center"><img src="/mountain.JPG" alt="alt mountain" title="Mountain" /></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: center"><span style="color:#888888"><em>Awesome views</em></span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: center"><img src="/clouds.JPG" alt="alt mountain" title="Clouds" /></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: center"><span style="color:#888888"><em>Clouds looked heavenly</em></span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Views were crazy, it was the perfect time to be there to appreciate the clouds, sun, tress and, fields. Sadly, I still don't know much about cameras, I might need a better one or it might just be me. I've heard using the auto option on cameras is not always good.</p>
<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>
<p>For the final day, we went back to <strong>Bajos del Toro</strong> to se more rivers. This time, we didn't swim, just walked around. One crazy thing I saw was a group of older foreigners hiking up and down the hills like it was nothing. I was a bit struggling.</p>
<p>At one point my family stopped to rest but I kept going untill I met one of the guides at the top of the hill. I started a small talk just to not make it awkward. I was surprised to know that he was a 17 year old guy working while school started again. Massive respect, I was playing videogames in my vacations. He said he wanted to save some money to go to an exchange to Europe.</p>
<p>As he talked, his real accent slipped out for a second, and so I realized he wasn't from Costa Rica. When I asked him where he was from, he mentrioned a nearby town. He clearly did not wanna say where he was from which I understand because I'm the exact same. I don't like when people see me as someone from Venezuela, I even avoid my accent unless I’m around other Venezuelans because they get really annoyed if they realize you’re hiding it.</p>
<p>I was thinking: "He should be proud of what he is" but then again, I'm no different. I don't want people to associate me to any country. Can't be proud of a country with a terrible reputation.</p>
<p>Despite that, I learned that no matter what reputation a country has, it will not always define their people. I hope that guy saves up money to travel, he seemed like a really nice guy dreaming big. That was our last place to visit, after that we just went home.</p>
<p>It was a really nice trip.</p>
