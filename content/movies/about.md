Earlier this year, I became interested in movies. The list shows all the movies I've seen since then. The colors next to the titles mean the following:


<div>
    <span style="color: #1976d2;">■</span> The Best 
</div>

<div>
    <span style="color: #388e3c;">■</span> Good 
</div>

<div>
    <span style="color: #f9a825;">■</span> Regular 
</div>

<div>
    <span style="color: #d32f2f;">■</span> Bad 
</div>

If you have seen an amazing movie, please suggest it to me via email or Discord. I like older movies, but I'm open to any good cinema!

I will gradually add new articles talking about the movies I liked the most. 

Thanks
