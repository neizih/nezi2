This section was a recipes section before, I did learn how to cook some of the meals
but I was too lazy to upload it. I think a blog section can be more interesting for the future, I have so many blog ideas in my head. For this one tho I'm just gonna talk about some random stuff.

### Changes to the website

***Pagination***: I can't figure out how to use pagination with Hugo, which is the framework I use to make this website work. Take for example the previous page, each time I add a new blog the list will grow, not having pagination will make the list infinitely grow making it look ugly, specially for this layout. I need something like this: 

```
                            1 2 3 4 ... Next > 
                    
                                 Blog 1 
                                 Blog 2 
                                 Blog 3

                            1 2 3 4 ... Next >
```

I've considered moving to another framework, but that would be very painful to do, I don't think I have any other option anyway.

Good news is, uploading content to the website has never been easier, I can create a file on my PC and remotely upload content with ***rsync***. Before this, I had to delete the entire page, clone it, move it to another directory, and build it, only to realize I made a spelling mistake, making me repeat the entire process.

Also I might change the layout for blogs and trips section like this! I think it's less distracting. I like the font but It's not pleasnt to read in Times New Roman. If you are reading this tell me what you think about that.

Cool song: seeing the same song displayed each time you enter this website must be very lame. I'm sure this website is not very visited but imagine entering one year later and seeing the same song displayed. Now that I use ***Spotify*** I can use their API to display songs I'm listening to in real time, which would be cool to learn.

### In another news

The other day Youtube recommended me a band called *Nymb*, a band I've never heard of in my life. The album was really good for the few views it had, that might be because it's uploaded by a random user but, when you see their spotify listeners, they only have a bit above ***1000 monthly listeners***. Apparently it's a band from the 90's, and they last performed in 2001, they have a very modern sound, it's cool. ***Youtube*** decided to recommend me a band which their last song was 20 years ago and have 1k views. Give it a listen and tell me what you think!
