I liked the old design, but there were details I never fixed. Since I was already switching frameworks, I took the chance to change the frontend too.

I got the idea from a Notion-style layout I saw on Pinterest. I made it chaotic but inside a box, with empty space around it. I think it looks cool with that contrast.

Blog pages still look super boring, though. I need to figure out a better way to show them. If you're reading this after an update, just know it used to be boring.

This page isn’t finished yet. I still need to add my own images, videos, and maybe even art if I ever learn how. I can change this in so many ways, so who knows how it'll end up. I think this was worth it, this design is more flexible than the last one.

Tell me what you think about the new frontend. Here’s how my old website looked:
