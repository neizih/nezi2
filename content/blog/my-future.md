Recently my coworker asked me something like: 

"What are you future plans?"

"To take that 3 month long trip with my friend" I said

He didn't show it but, I'm sure he wasn't expecting that answer, I guess he wanted me to answer with some job or something. He understood the situation and kept talking about how I could take the trip instead of talking about jobs and money, which I deeply appreciate. 

Even tho the decision has been taken, I still wonder if the risk is worth it. My loved ones say it's a terrible idea and that I should take advantage of my age and degree to work as hard as possible. I understand the vision but I can't see myself waiting to be close to 50 to finally start doing the stuff I wanted to do at my early 20s. 

At the same time, no job will give me a 3 month break specially because I'm easily replaceable.

Weather it's exciting, stressful, sad or happy, I always think about my future. You can't avoid it! People always say you should focus on the present, but you can't ignore what's ahead of you specially on your early 20's, an entire future depends on me. )
