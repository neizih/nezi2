I almost always live in the present, but recently, I've been thinking a lot about the future and what it might be like. Older people often tell me one of two things: that I should take advantage of my age to have a good time, or that I should take advantage of it to work as hard as possible and have a secured future. It feels like having an angel and a devil on either side of my shoulders.

For my future, what I'm most excited about is the plan I have with my best friend to travel to another continent for three months, an idea I can only imagine could happen in a movie. If I think about anything every day, it's that trip, I can't put into words how excited I am.

At the same time, someone on one of my shoulders tells me that I should better think about securing my future as soon as possible. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a college degree in their hands to use, but if my memories for the next few decades are of me in an office staring at a screen, I don't know what the point of still being alive is.

The trip will help me live a real life, away from the internet, , meeting new people,  doing activities, learn about cultures, and places, recording videos to document everything, taking photos, trying new foods, creating memories, and a lot of other things. Living life as it should be, as I never allowed myself to, connected to reality.

On the other hand, I don't want to disappoint my loved ones after everything they've given me. I don't want them to think I'm a good-for-nothing who wastes his time traveling. Maybe I sound dramatic because it's only been three months, but it has quite a few risks and implications in my case.

Returning to the older people, whatever path they've taken, it seems they've lived long enough to be able to give me advice. The decision has already been made, although there's always a voice in the back of my head worrying about what might happen.

I want to read this in the future and laugh at all the worries I have today, knowing that in the end everything worked out as it should have, and that I can even take more trips. If it went wrong this page probably went down because I ran out of money.
