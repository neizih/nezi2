I never go to beaches, whenever my family invites me to go, I refuse it. It's dirty, very sunny, very hot, the sand is annoying, there's a lot of people, and many other things. That's why I only go to rivers, it's calm, clean, and fresh. This time I gave the beach one last opportunity.

### Day 1

The first beach we went to was *Biesanz*. It's a very hidden beach, but there were still a good amount of people, just enough to not be annoying. The beach didn't look colorful and crystal clear that day sadly. I don't have any interesting photos of it.

It was the first beach in my life with the perfect temperature. They are usually freezing, so I have to leave after some minutes in. That beach was just cold enough to be refreshing. Unfortunately, it was full of large rocks. No matter how deep I swam, I always hit a rock.

### Day 2

The day before, one of the guys working at the beach told us about a river nearby, so we decided to go. On our way, there was a well known palm tree plantation, it was miles long, lined with palm trees on both sides of the road. After several minutes between palm trees, the GPS took us to an unpaved road inside the plantations. We had to drive another hour to reach the river.

There was no sign indicating that there was a river, we were probably on private property, and we were in the middle of perfectly aligned trees. We didn't have the best of vibes. After turning around, we headed to Manuel Antonio beach.

We arrived at the beach between 7 and 8 AM, the weather was beautiful. Once again, the beach was the perfect temperature, there were no giant rocks, and the waves were relatively large. Jumping over waves is a lot of fun, it reminded me of my childhood with my brother on the island where we were born.

It felt so good to be at the beach I can't remember anymore why I started to hate it in the first place, maybe it was just a typical teenage thing. Diving, floating, jumping waves, and swimming with all I had until I was exhausted felt really good.

After a few hours, my dad invited us to go jet skiing, something I'd always wanted to do since I was a kid. We decided that my brother would go first and I would go with him, a terrible idea. Holding someone on a jet ski is painful,  you don't know when they're accelerating, and you can't stand. So, every time we jumped a wave on the jet ski and landed, my lower back was getting destroyed.

After 15 minutes, it was my turn. My brother stayed on the boat with the captain and left me with the jet ski. As soon as I started the engine, I stood on the jet ski and went full gas, as deep as I could go. Even with a life jacket, it's scary to think about how deep the water is at that point.

Being closer to the island that looked tiny from a distance is crazy, it became a large mountain right in front of me. Being in the middle of the sea, with its sound, the movement of the waves, and no one around, was peaceful. I regret not taking videos, I felt like I should have lived the moment and use as much gas as possible, but I would have liked to take at least one video.

I'm writing this months after that trip, I've wanted to go back but I haven't done that yet. I've been thinking of learning how to surf with my friend, as someone born on an island I should know how to surf. 

It was a great trip that I want to remember and leave engraved here forever. Thank you so much for reading.
