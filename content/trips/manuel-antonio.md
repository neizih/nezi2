I never go to beaches, I hate them. Whenever my family invites me to go, I refuse it. It's dirty, painfully sunny, hot, the sand is annoying, and there is way too many people, among other things. That's what my past self would have said. This time, I wanted to give the beach a chance.

This trip was two days long.

### Day 1

The first beach we went to was *Biesanz*. It's a very hidden beach, but there were still a good number of people, just enough to avoid being annoying. The beach didn't look colorful and crystal clear that day, sadly. I don't have any interesting photos of it.

It was the first beach in my life with the perfect temperature. They are usually freezing, I usually have to leave after a few minutes in them. That beach was just cold enough to be refreshing. Unfortunately, it was full of large rocks. No matter how deep I swam, I always hit a rock. My feet are covered in sores.

At one point, my brother and I were playing with a tennis ball on the beach, and one of his shots landed a little far from me. I watched as another person went in search of it at the same time as me. When we arrived, I asked him if he wanted to throw the ball to my brother. Maybe it was nerves, but that shot the person took definitely wasn't going to my brother; he had to swim a few meters for it. She laughed embarrassedly and apologized, to which I told him it was no problem while smiling. He wasn't from Costa Rica, and English wasn't his primary language either; it was hilarious. She was beautiful.

Day 2
The day before, one of the people working at the beach told us about a river nearby, so we decided to go. Along the way, there was a well-known palm tree plantation; it was miles long, lined with palm trees on both sides of the road. After several minutes between palm trees, the GPS took us to an unpaved road inside the plantations. We had to drive another hour to reach the river.

There was no sign indicating that there was a river; we were probably on private property, and we were in the middle of perfectly aligned trees. We didn't get a good vibe. After turning around, we headed to Manuel Antonio Beach.

We arrived at the beach between 7 and 8 AM, and the weather was beautiful. Once again, the beach was the perfect temperature, there were no giant rocks, and the waves were relatively large. Jumping over the newly formed waves is a lot of fun; it reminds me of my childhood with my brother on the island where we were born.

Don't forget the biggest island!
It felt so good to be at the beach that I can't remember why I started to hate it in the first place; maybe it was just a typical teenage thing. Diving, floating, jumping waves, and swimming with all my might until I was exhausted felt incredibly good.

After a few hours, my dad invited us to go jet skiing, something I'd always wanted to do since I was a kid. We decided that my brother would go first and I would go with himâ€”a terrible idea. Being held by someone on a jet ski is painful. You don't know when they're accelerating, and you can't stand still. Every time we jumped a wave on the jet ski, we landed with an impact that slowly shattered my lower back.

After 15 minutes of torture, it was my turn. My brother stayed on the boat with the captain and left me with the jet ski. As soon as I started the engine, I stood on the jet ski and pressed the throttle to the floor, as deep as I could go. Even with a life jacket, it's very scary knowing there are only a few meters of water below, but it passes quickly.

Previous island, but closer
I can't put into words the feeling of being closer to an island that looked tiny from a distance; in that moment, it became a large mountain right in front of me. Being in the middle of the sea, with its sound, the movement of the waves, and no one around, was incredible. It was a huge shame not to have taken a video. I felt like I should have taken advantage of the moment to use as much gas as possible, but I would have liked to take a second to record videos.

I wish I could go back to the beach very soon. My skin took on a pinkish hue and made me feel colorful and alive. It reminded me of when I saw a group of young backpackers in the city. They were smiling and their eyes were full of life. They made me feel happy just by passing by. I've etched that moment in my mind; I want to be that kind of person.

It was a great trip that I want to remember and leave engraved here forever. Thank you so much for reading.
